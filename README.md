# WaveRipper - Godot VR Demo in C#

A simple VR demo created with the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) using C#.

The player must slice through the incoming wave segments by moving their hands to adjust the shape of a beam that extends between them.

**Note:** This has been developed and tested using an Oculus Rift CV1 headset and controllers. Running this demo with other headsets/controllers may require changing the buttonIndex values in the _OnArVrControllerButtonPressed(...)_ method in [Controller.cs](https://github.com/mryderie/waveripper-godot-vr-csharp/blob/master/Scenes/Scripts/Controller.cs).
